# My First Neural Networks  

This notebook explores fundamental neural network architectures, focusing on MNIST classification. It includes:  

- A **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** for digit classification  
- A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** achieving 99.3% accuracy  
- Training and evaluation functions  
- Model saving and loading using `torch.save` and `state_dict`  

## Requirements  

Install dependencies with:  

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
